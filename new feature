A new feature I've decided to add is the Toasts, which is basically a an alert message.
The toast will now display the message "Welcome to my anime recommendations! You can rate any given anime by clicking on the anime picture." when the page loads, which gives users additional information about how they can interact with the application.
This instruction is important because the rating feature is pretty hidde. Most people wouldn't think to click on a picture to rate.
